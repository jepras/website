# Test Components

</CalloutBox>

## Collapsible Test

<CollapsibleSection title="Test Section">
  This is a test collapsible section.
</CollapsibleSection>

## Hover Test

## Emerald Card Test

<EmeraldCard title="Case Study: Email Integration">
  This is an example of how you can use the EmeraldCard component to display case descriptions, 
  project details, or any other content that needs to stand out with our emerald theme.
  
  The card uses the same emerald color scheme as our buttons, providing visual consistency 
  across the design system.
</EmeraldCard>

<EmeraldCard variant="subtle" title="Subtle Variant">
  This is the subtle variant of the EmeraldCard, which uses a lighter background 
  and regular text color for less prominent content.
</EmeraldCard>
