# Main Title (H1)

This is the main title of our blog post. It's the largest and most prominent header.

## Section Header (H2)

This is a section header that introduces a new topic or section within our post.

### Subsection Header (H3)

This is a subsection header that provides more specific organization within a section.

#### Minor Section (H4)

This is a minor section header for very specific topics or details.

##### Detail Header (H5)

This is a detail header for very specific points or examples.

###### Smallest Header (H6)

This is the smallest header level, typically used for very minor organizational purposes.

## Another Section (H2)

Here's another main section to demonstrate the hierarchy.

### Another Subsection (H3)

This subsection contains additional content.

#### Example with Content (H4)

This section includes some actual content to show how headers work with text.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

##### Code Example (H5)

Here's an example of how headers work with code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

###### Final Note (H6)

This demonstrates the complete header hierarchy from H1 to H6.

## Summary

This blog post demonstrates all the different header levels available in MDX, from the main title (H1) down to the smallest header (H6). Each level serves a different purpose in organizing content and creating a clear hierarchy for readers.
