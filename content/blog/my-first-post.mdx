Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts here.

This post is written in MDX, which allows me to mix Markdown and JSX.

## Heading 2

Here's some more content.

## Interactive Component Examples

Below are examples of how you can use custom components in your MDX blog posts:

### Animated System Diagram

<AnimatedSystemDiagram />

### Interactive Chart

<InteractiveChart title="Sample Data Visualization" data={[15, 25, 35, 45, 55]} />

You can also pass props to customize the components!
