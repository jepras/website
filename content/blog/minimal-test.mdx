## HoverCard Example

Here's an example of the HoverCard component. Try hovering over the <HoverCard trigger="highlighted text">This is the trigger text that you hover over to see the card content. You can put any React elements here as the trigger.</HoverCard> to see the hover card in action.

You can also use it with different content:

<HoverCard 
  trigger="technical term" 
  triggerClassName="text-primary font-semibold"
>
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground !mt-0">Technical Definition</h4>
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      This is a detailed explanation of the technical term that appears when you hover over the trigger text.
    </p>
    <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
      <strong>Usage:</strong> Commonly used in software development contexts.
    </div>
  </div>
</HoverCard>
