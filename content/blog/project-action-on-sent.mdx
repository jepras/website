*Press send. Do the associated task. Send another email. Do the associated task.
.. And often the task is defined directly in the sent email* ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

One busy director, in need of more hours in the day, was tired by this loop. They wanted to save the time and the mental energy drained by doing follow up tasks after emails were sent. It felt inefficient to do this menial grunt work again and again. 

With the unstructured & varying data in emails, then this couldn't be done with regular automations. So we decided to create an AI Agent system that could relieve him of one of these mundane tasks, and then expand to more workflows later.

This is a writeup of "Action on Sent".

      Technology passionate, but not an engineer by education.

     I strongly believe that I am learning so much faster than when I learned to program 8 years ago. I am not spending months getting a basic frontend to-do list app made that no one will use.

## Description
The system serves as a bridge between email communications and CRM management, automating the process of capturing sales opportunities in the CRM. 

It addresses the common business challenge of ensuring that potential sales leads from email communications are properly tracked in a CRM system without requiring manual data entry.

It works in the following way:

1. The AI Orchestrator is pinged when an email webhook triggers.
2. The Analysis AI analyses the text and decides whether it‚Äôs a sales deal.
3. The CRM AI looks for duplicates in the CRM and creates necessary deal and objects.
4. The Logging AI logs the outcome of the other AI‚Äôs for transparency & future improvements.

<AnimatedSystemDiagram />
### Why the use of an AI Agent flow for this instead of Zapier/Make?

The email analyser makes text analysis hassle free. Deciding whether something is a potential deal = easy.

```
Show example of emails that are deals versus those that aren‚Äôt. 
```

The AI Agent can extract context from the entire email chain and fill out fields as needed and fill in empty values when none is found.

Having worked with CRM automation before, it is a hassle to work with missing fields, missing context from long conversations, etc. An automation that creates objects wrongfully and has to be changed destroys the whole purpose of it.

An AI can do this job much better.

<EmailExtractionDiagram />

The AI analyses the sent email. Understands that it is an offer. Also extracts Bob‚Äôs full name and organisation from the email as it decides his email address doesn‚Äôt give the right info. It also extracts a short summary from the full email chain. And it extracts that the next step is for Hans to get back.

This can easily be extracted to some structured output and is then easy to use to check for duplicates, both strict and fuzzy logic. 

The CRM agent then sees the contact email doesn‚Äôt exists, so it creates it. The organisation does exist though, so it connects the new contact with the organisation. The contact doesn‚Äôt have any pre existing deals, so a new one is created with the right name, organisation, an email chain summary in the notes and follow up task for Bob to follow up in 2 days as Hans wants to get this done before next week.

<EmailToCrmPipeline />

This system could have been done with just 1 agent, but giving each agent different context increases the likelihood of correct outcomes. It might have been overkill for this project, but we wanted to make the project future proof and ready to automate more automations from emails in the future.

- want to read more about the technical considerations
- are curious about my learnings (mostly related to how to work with LLMs)
- think that there must be some bigger potential with this application?

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI application (deployed on Railway)
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase
- **Integrations**: Pipedrive CRM, Microsoft Outlook
- **AI**: LLM API for sales opportunity detection. Use OpenRouter
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend) through Dockerfiles
- **Triggers**: Webhook-driven when user sends emails
- **Real-time**: Supabase subscriptions for live dashboard updates

My own aim with this project was to learn how to build a production ready AI Agent system using LLMs. There are a few steps in that:

1. Figuring out the system architecture
2. Figuring out what deployment providers to use
3. Decide where on the scale of locally ready to enterprise ready the system should be
4. Figuring out what LLM to use


### Figuring out the system architecture

The system required:

- User authentication
- OAuth third party integrations
- A database
- Something catching the sent emails. Webhooks? Or message queues?
- A backend for the AI orchestration

Working with LLMs best practices state that one should discuss with multiple LLMs before generating a final specification doc that then can be used with an execution agent like Claude Code, Gemini CLI or Cursor.

When doing that it‚Äôs important to remind the LLM to consider the scale of your application and what your learning goals actually are. It will often suggest very scaleable systems, which might be overkill for the beginning of a project.
